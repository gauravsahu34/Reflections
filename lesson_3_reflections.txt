When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  I want to use a remote repository when I want to collaborate with other people. When I want
  to show my work to other people. Also, using remote will help in backup my essential data.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I like pulling changes manually because i dont want unexpected change in my code.
	manually pulling will enable me to pull changes only when i want to do that.
